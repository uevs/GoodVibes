A SwiftUI frontend for my Vapor project [VaporVibes](https://github.com/uevs/VaporVibes).

Available for download [on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/oDaC4Crc).

## Description
This project allows Academy hackers to send good vibes to each other with an iOS app.

The app connects to my Vapor web-app currently hosted on Heroku.

The design aims to be minimal and with references to vaporwave aestethic, a style associated with relax and good mood, it's also a play on the name of the framework I used for the backend.

The app has been built entirely in SwiftUI, with the exception of the half-modal view which uses and UIKit element.

## Animations

Since the app is made with SwiftUI, it was easy to experiment with animations, animating the logo and other elements.

## The process

This app was built with multiple goals in mind: strenghtening my SwiftUI skills, learning more about UIKit, learning about networking in Swift. Since I had previously built a web-app with Vapor, I wanted to make things real and connect it with iOS app, the make a complete full-stack experience.

These are all the steps I needed to take:

1. Learning about Vapor and Swift on Server.
2. Learn more about networking, databases, APIs, Docker.
3. Setting up a functioning Vapor app in my local environment and build the API I needed.
4. Learning how to deploy said app on Heroku.
5. Building a SwiftUI interface.
6. Creating cool animations!
7. Using a UIViewRepresentable to get a much needed half-modal.
8. Managing GET calls with Swift.
9. Managing POST calls with Swift.
10. Put everything on TestFlight to share it with my Academy peers.

It's been a long process, but I'm amazed by how many things I could learn and achieve in just two weeks. 

The app is now [on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/oDaC4Crc), fully functioning. Give it a try and send your good vibe to everyone!
